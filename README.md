Explanation of Regular Expressions in Route Path

In this server, we use a regular expression in the route path to match multiple URL patterns. Specifically, the route /user(name)? is defined. Here's how it works:

    /user: This URL pattern matches exactly with "/user".
    /username: This URL pattern matches with "/username".
    Both patterns respond with the message "Hello, user or username!".

The (name)? part of the regular expression makes the "name" part optional, so it matches both "/user" and "/username". Regular expressions in route paths provide flexibility in handling various URL variations using a single route definition.
